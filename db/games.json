Native Islanders, known as the Dahan, have learned how to co-exist with the spirits, but with a healthy dose of fear and reverence. However, now, the island has been &quot;discovered&quot; by invaders from a far-off land. These would-be colonists are taking over the land and upsetting the natural balance, destroying the presence of Spirits as they go. As Spirits, you must grow in power and work together to drive the invaders from your island... before it's too late!",

In the process they will enhance their abilities with experience and loot, discover new locations to explore and plunder, and expand an ever-branching story fueled by the decisions they make.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis is a legacy game with a persistent and changing world that is ideally played over many game sessions. After a scenario, players will make decisions on what to do, which will determine how the story continues, kind of like a &quot;Choose Your Own Adventure&quot; book. Playing through a scenario is a cooperative affair where players will fight against automated monsters using an innovative card system to determine the order of play and what a player does on their turn.",

Other than each player's individual hidden objective card, the only elements of luck or variability are &quot;Encounter&quot; cards that players will draw as they interact with the citizens of newly explored lands. Each encounter card provides the player with several options, allowing them to mitigate the luck of the draw through their selection. Combat is also driven by choices, not luck or randomness.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<i>Scythe</i> uses a streamlined action-selection mechanism (no rounds or phases) to keep gameplay moving at a brisk pace and reduce downtime between turns. While there is plenty of direct conflict for players who seek it, there is no player elimination.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEvery part of <i>Scythe</i> has an aspect of engine-building to it. Players can upgrade actions to become more efficient, build structures that improve their position on the map, enlist new recruits to enhance character abilities, activate mechs to deter opponents from invading, and expand their borders to reap greater types and quantities of resources. These engine-building aspects create a sense of momentum and progress throughout the game. The order in which players improve their engine adds to the unique feel of each game, even when playing one faction multiple times.",

        "description": "In Agricola (Latin for &quot;farmer&quot;), you're a farmer in a wooden shack with your spouse and little else. On a turn, you get to take only two actions, one for you and one for the spouse, from all the possibilities you'll find on a farm: collecting clay, wood or stone; building fences; and so on. You might think about having kids in order to get more work accomplished, but first you need to expand your house. And what are you going to feed all the little rug rats? Agricola is a turn based game. There are 14 game turns plus 6 harvest phases (after turn 4, 7, 9, 11, 13, and 14). Each player starts with two playing tokens (farmer and wife) and thus can take two actions per turn. There are multiple options, and while the game progresses, you'll have more and more: first thing in a turn, a new action card is flipped over. Problem: Each action can be taken just once per turn, so it's important to do some things with high preference. Each player also starts with a hand of 7 Occupation cards (of more than 160 total) and 7 Minor Improvement cards (of more than 140 total) that he may use during the game if they fit in his/her strategy. This amounts to countless strategies, some depending on your card hand. Sometimes it's a good choice to stay on course, sometimes you better react on what your opponents do. Agricola can also be played without cards (family game) and can even be played solo. Designed by Uwe Rosenberg.",

        "description": "Architects of the West Kingdom is set at the end of the Carolingian Empire, circa 850 AD. As royal architects, players compete to impress their King and maintain their noble status by constructing various landmarks throughout his newly appointed domain. Players will need to collect raw materials, hire apprentices and keep a watchful eye on their workforce. These are treacherous times. Rival architects will stop at nothing to slow your progress. Will you remain virtuous, or be found in the company of thieves and black marketeers?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe aim of Architects of the West Kingdom is to be the player with the most Victory Points (VP) at the game's end. Points are gained by constructing various Buildings and advancing work on the Archbishop's Cathedral. Throughout the game, players will need to make a lot of moral decisions. However, only at the game's end will their virtue be judged. A few underhanded deals here and there might not seem like much, but fall too far and you will be punished. The game ends once a set number of constructions have been completed.",

The Enhanced Edition also features 36 divider cards, one for each hero, villain and environment from the core game, both expansions and even promo characters. The 120 round tokens and 42 rectangular tokens are useful for tracking hero and villain HP, as well as conditional modifiers that can occur throughout the game.

In the following years, food production increased significantly to feed the population growth. Linen was increasingly substituted by the cheaper cotton and raising sheep was given high importance. More and more distilleries were founded and whisky became the premium alcoholic beverage in Europe. Players represent historic clans with unique abilities and compete to produce, trade and export agricultural goods and of course whisky! The game comes with nine different clans, a modular board with 16 configurations, nine port bonuses and nine round scoring tiles.",

There are five types of cards: Travelers, Production, Destination, Governance, and Prosperity. Cards generate resources (twigs, resin, pebbles, and berries), grant abilities, and ultimately score points. The interactions of the cards reveal numerous strategies and a near infinite variety of working cities.<br />\r\nc) Prepare for the next Season: Workers are returned to the players supply and new workers are added.

Each die, in order, is then resolved and the results are immediate! This gets very exciting, as it allows the player to pull-off unseen combos and surprise other players. But don't fret! Other players have the option to copy other player's actions... at a cost!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn addition to upgrading galaxies, effective resource management provides luck-mitigating options that can sway the game in a calculated player's favor.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs players expand their galaxy by colonizing other planets through economic and diplomatic influence, they gain victory points AND the special powers brought in by those planets!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou are the ruler of your galaxy and there are no limits to your expansion!",

The city was almost totally destroyed.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLisboa is thus played, in part, on a representational map of the city. During the planning of the downtown re-building project, the type of businesses permitted in each street was pre-determined. The clockmakers and goldsmiths had their street; as did the bookstores and libraries; the tailors and silk vendors; and the toolmakers as well. This all comes into play on the Lisboa gameboard. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nPlayers represent the nobility of Lisboa who will use their influence in the reconstruction and business development of the new city. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn rebuilding the city, players will make use of the Royal Builder, who works with the architects to build Lisboa anew, while the Marquis will provide aid in the development of commerce. The King will provide players with political help in re-opening the beautiful new city. But the true reason you are rebuilding the city is not for greatness, or even fame or fortune. As a nobleman or noblewoman of Lisboa, your primary motivation is the acquisition of Wigs--a most important trading commodity of the Era, and the means of scoring points in the game.",

To this end, you guide your scions through their careers, exchanging favors for positions in London or plush colonial posts. Players collectively control the Company, facing tough budgetary decisions and conflicting interests. Should a Governor conduct a campaign to expand company holdings or invest in his region's infrastructure? Perhaps the honest tax revenues would be better diverted to expand his summer estate back home... As the game continues, the Company may face open rebellion in India or outright failure as it grapples with increasingly bold attempts at regulation from the British government. It's even possible that the Company's trade monopoly will be revoked, leaving the players to form and operate their own trading firms. Each game offers a huge range of possibilities, informed chiefly by the decisions the players make. In addition, players can tailor their experience by using one of the three tournament scenarios that cover the Early, Mid, and Late Company that can be played in about 90 minutes. The game also offers a full campaign game that will take players from 1720 to 1857 in an evening.",

However, the team must constantly keep the balance between survival and slaughter: as the zombicide's going on, the &quot;Danger level&quot; is going up and infected are growing in numbers. Any misstep can turn to disaster. Zombicide is a fun and easy game with cool minis in an archetypical, popular and comics-inspired environment. Ambiance is constantly kept between &quot;beat'em up&quot; and &quot;survival horror&quot; as characters keep on turning from preys to predators. Humor and gloom happily marry in a zombie-fest. Find weapons, kill zombies. The more zombies you kill, the more skilled you get, the more skilled you get, the more zombies appear. The only way out is Zombicide! Play 10 scenarios on different maps made from the included modular map tiles, or create your own.",

Two years later, through masterful propaganda and factional maneuver, Castro, his brother Raul, and iconic revolutionary Che Guevara had united disparate guerrillas and exploited Cubans' deep opposition to their dictator Fulgencio Batista y Zaldivar.  Castro's takeover of the country became a model for Leftist insurgency.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFollowing up on GMT Games' Andean Abyss, the COIN Series next volume, Cuba Libre, takes 1 to 4 players into the Cuban Revolution.  Castro's Marxist &quot;26 July Movement&quot; must expand from its bases in the Sierra Maestra mountains to fight its way to Havana.  Meanwhile, anti-communist student groups, urban guerrillas, and ex-patriots try to de-stabilize the Batista regime from inside and out, while trying not to pave the way for a new dictatorship under Castro.  Batista's Government must maintain steam to counter the twin insurgency, while managing two benefactors:  its fragile US Alliance and its corrupting Syndicate skim.  And in the midst of the turmoil, Meyer Lansky and his Syndicate bosses will jockey to keep their Cuban gangster paradise alive. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nCuba Libre will be easy to learn for Andean Abyss players-both volumes share the same innovative COIN system.  Like Volume I, Cuba Libre is equally playable solitaire or by multiple players up to 4-and with a shorter time to completion than Andean Abyss.  But Cuba Libre's situation and strategic challenges will be new.  A deck of 48 fresh events brings 1950s Cuba to life.",

Most of the cash has been hidden away, and the rest has been invested in businesses throughout the city. Everything is going according to plan until the police get a breakthrough in their investigation. Accusations are made, fingers are pointed, and after a heated argument, you decide to go your separate ways.<br />\r\n Chaos ensues as the SWAT team is called in and start to close off the city’s exits. Your only choice now is to escape the city before it is completely locked down. But you need a plan — a good route that allows you to leave the city while recovering as much of the money as possible.<br />\r\n You will need to call in some favors and hire the local gangs to create diversions. Bribing the Police would be a good idea too, but it isn't cheap. Disguises may help, but they don’t fool everyone. Setting the Police on the trail of your former colleagues will give you a better chance of escape, but the other thieves are thinking the same thing...<br />\r\n <p>Will you escape the city with the most money, or will the Police lockdown the city before you can escape?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Escape Plan, players are the thieves, but they may influence the cops' moves every turn. The robbers move on a modular board trying to reach the best spots to recover their loot and escape from the city with more money than the other thieves. The cops are trying to thwart their escape plan — by force if necessary. The players play cards to aid their escape and slow the other players down. The players take actions that allow them to move and to engage gangs, mules, and snitches.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a tactical game with no direct conflict, it contains asymmetric roles set by missions that players may achieve during the game while avoiding the police. The players' roles as thieves are individual with every player for themselves. In the end, only the player who escapes with the most cash wins.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The game design is influenced by great heist films.</p>",

The Emperor has inherited a country in disarray after years of mismanagement and corruption. Realising the depth of chaos his father’s long reign had caused, the Longqing Emperor set about reforming the government by re-employing talented officials previously banished by his father. The Emperor resides in the Forbidden city, which was the seat of many emperors under the Ming Dynasty. The Forbidden City is currently known as “Gùgõng” (Imperial Palace) by the people of China. Constructed from 1406 to 1420, the complex consists of 980 buildings and covers 72 ha (over 180 acres). It is also under the Ming Dynasty that the Great Wall of China was rebuilt, fortified and expanded. During this period, China was under heavy attack the Mongols, so maintaining the Great Wall was essential. Most of what we now have left of Great Wall, we owe to the Ming dynasty.</p><p>The country was already famous for its very intricate bureaucracy, but this also led to a lot of corruption. However, the Longqing Emperor tried to eradicate corruption as much as he could, by simply having it officially prohibited, and punishable by death.</p><p>This measure seemed successful at first, but as we all know, it is not so simple to keep perfect control over one’s “loyal” subjects. At the imperial court, the highest officials would pretend to uphold the ban on corruption, and instead of simply accepting money, a new custom saw the light of day: the exchange of gifts.</p><p>If a petitioner visited an official to present a request, they would also present a gift. And naturally, the official would return the honour by presenting a gift in return. If the gift of the petitioner was something quite valuable, like, say, a Jade statue, and the return gift from the official was a cheap paper fan, it was hard to regard this as an act of bribery. However, both knew very well how valuable the symbolism of said item could be…</p><p>“Gùgõng” uses this extraordinary custom as its basis. The players take on the role of powerful Chinese families trying to gain influence and power by bribing certain officials responsible for certain tasks, by offering suitable gifts.</p><p>A player wins by gaining an audience with the emperor. If several players succeed to do this, the player with the most VPs amongst those players wins the game.</p>",

The board represents the solar environment: two layers of orbit around the Sun (Upper and Lower Orbit), and three layers within the Sun itself (the Convective, Radiative, and Core). The deeper you take actions, the higher your rewards, but the faster the instability of the Sun is increased. Your Mothership rotates slowly in orbit around the Sun, and this is the only place your ships can launch from to perform useful tasks in the solar environment. You can either convert ships into stations or use the ships to activate yours and other players' stations. If you activate your own stations you get the full reward, while activating other player's stations you split the reward with the owner. You gain energy by activating Energy Nodes, and you use this energy to either activate Ship Foundries to build new ships (which you need since you are constantly losing ships by converting them into new stations) or activate Transmit Towers to transmit the energy back to your Ark to turn into Momentum (which is ultimately how your Ark will escape). But you cannot enter the Sun without converting ships into Solar Gates which span the high energy membranes separating one layer of the sun from the next. You must carefully manage your time and resources in order to transmit the most energy back to your Ark before the Sun is lost forever. With any luck, some small collection of your last planetary residents will escape the solar system before it is engulfed by the oncoming supernova!",

As revolutionary change burned through that ancient civilization, Washington would apply its armament and its operations research.

A unique multi-faction treatment of the Vietnam War, Fire in the Lake will take 1 to 4 players on US heliborne sweeps of the jungle and Communist infiltration of the South, and into inter-allied conferences, Saigon politics, interdiction of the Ho Chi Minh Trail, air defense of Northern infrastructure, graduated escalation, and media war.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs with earlier COIN Series volumes, players of Fire in the Lake will face difficult strategic decisions with each card.

While on the trail, these hikers will take actions and collect memories of the places your hikers visit. These memories are represented by various resource tokens like mountains and forests. Collecting these memories in sets will allow players to trade them in to visit a National Park at the end of each hike.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Each trail represents one season of the year, and each season, the trails will change and grow steadily longer. The trails, represented by tiles, get shuffled in between each season and laid out anew for the next round. Resources can be tough to come by especially when someone is at the place you’re trying to reach! Campfires allow you to share a space and time with other hikers. Canteens and Gear can also be used to improve your access to resources through the game.

Into this cockpit dropped a multinational post-9/11 coalition to root out al-Qaeda and replace the hardline-Islamist Taliban regime that harbored it.  A quick invasion and regime change portended quiet reconstruction and good governance, but it was not to be so.  In their sanctuary across Pakistan's border, the Taliban rebuilt for an insurgency that would ensnare the Coalition in the tangle of Afghan rivalries, shifting allegiances, and warlordism that the West could at first only distantly grasp. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe latest volume in Volko Ruhnke's COIN Series takes 1 to 4 players into the Afghan conflict of today's headlines, this time in a unique collaboration between two top designers of boardgames on modern irregular warfare.  A Distant Plain teams Volko Ruhnke, the award-winning designer of LABYRINTH-The War on Terror, with Brian Train, a designer with 20 years' experience creating influential simulations such as Algeria, Somalia Interventions, Shining Path, and many others.  <br />\r\n<br />\r\nA Distant Plain features the same accessible game system as GMT's recent Andean Abyss but with new factions, capabilities, events, and objectives.  For the first time in the Series, two counterinsurgent (COIN) factions must reconcile competing visions for Afghanistan in order to coordinate a campaign against a dangerous twin insurgency: <br />\r\n<br />\r\n As the Coalition, how will you secure popular support for an Afghan Government that cares more about corrupt patronage and control than legitimacy?  Your high-tech forces are capable, but your publics are pressuring you to keep your footprint small:  how will you stabilize this complex country and get out? <br />\r\n<br />\r\n As the Government, how can you run the country when your foreign partners continually redirect your war effort?  You can reshape Afghanistan's human terrain by encouraging the resettlement of millions of refugees, and your Coalition-trained forces are potentially the most numerous of any faction.  But they are unsteady, and your war chest is not your own:  how will you keep your allies' firepower in-country long enough to ensure that you are the top dog once they leave? <br />\r\n<br />\r\n As the Taliban, how will you come back against the potent forces arrayed against you?  Islamism, Pashtun ethnic solidarity, and your Pakistani friends behind you will help you recruit and move with ease amidst the enemy.  But not all Afghanistan is Pashtun, its warlords are treacherous allies at best, your fighters are seasonal, and Pakistan's word is ever uncertain:  can you sting the occupier and his puppets to reawaken Islamic revolution without drawing an unrelenting fire upon yourself? <br />\r\n<br />\r\n As the Warlords, how will you secure your traditional ways against the intrusive centralizers of Kabul and the Taliban?  You profit from the country's lucrative opium crop, and your money can talk loudly to the Government's venal officials.  But your fighters have neither the equipment of the Coalition, the numbers of the national army and police, nor the fanaticism of the Taliban:  how will you block this latest cast of combatants from unifying the country and imposing their rule on you?",

If you found your settlements in the right places and skillfully trade your resources, then the odds will be in your favor.

Each player who owns a settlement adjacent to a terrain hex marked with the number rolled receives a resource produced by this hex. Hills produce brick, forests produce lumber, mountains produce ore, fields produce grain, and pastures produce wool.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We use these resources to expand across Catan: we build roads and new settlements, or we upgrade our existing settlements to cities. For example, a road costs 1 brick and 1 lumber. If we do not have the necessary resources, we can acquire them by trading with our opponents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Each settlement is worth 1 victory point and each city is worth 2 victory points.

Find the flying machine and escape before you all become permanent artifacts of the Forbidden Desert! When we launched Forbidden Island in 2010, we had an inkling that we had created a hit game but never to the point that we'd be prompted to make a sequel. Well, here we are a few years later with just that in hand. Our challenge to designer Matt Leacock was to create a game that would contain familiar elements (cooperative play, modular board), while offering up a completely different in-game experience. In addition, we wanted it to be simultaneously approachable to new players while upping the ante for those who felt they had mastered Forbidden Island. All this resulted in a fresh new game with an innovative set of mechanics, such as an ever-shifting board, individual resource management, and unique method for locating the flying machine parts. Hopefully we've achieved our goals and quenched your thirst for adventure!",
